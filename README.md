Use of SVM Classifier and improving recall score 



Recall Improvement Attempts

Since recall is very important for medical predictions, I experimented with different techniques to improve the recall score of the SVM classifier:

Decision Threshold Adjustment

Changed the classification threshold on the SVM decision function to classify more patients as positive.

Kernel Variations

Tested different kernels (linear, rbf) to check if non-linear decision boundaries improve recall.

(In this project, these changes did not significantly improve recall, but they are important steps in model evaluation and understanding trade-offs between precision and recall.)
